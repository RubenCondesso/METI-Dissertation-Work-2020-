# Output of the results from the detection of a regular immobile obstacle, in a simulated environment
#

# =================================================================================== Scenario conditions ===================================================================================== #

# Environment - simulated
#
# Obstacle - Wall
# Obstacle's caractheristics - Regular immobile obstacle, 3.20 x 2.50
$
# Distance (from the sensor) - 350cm
#
# Angle (between the sensor and the obstacle) - 45ยบ
#
# The sensor is placed slightly to the left of the wall
#
# The mean, variance, standard variation, standard error and percentage error of the collected values are calculated
#


# =================================================================================== Output starts here ===================================================================================== #

Can not detect neither the obstacle neither the hypotenuse (because the distance is bigger than 4 meters)
