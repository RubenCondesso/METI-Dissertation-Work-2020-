# Output of the results from the detection of an obstacle, using the Ultrasonic Sensor
#
# Obstacle (wall) is immobile and at 250cm from the sensor
#
# Ultrasonic sensor is 1 meter high -> about the height of a bicycle
#
# The angle between the sensor and the obstacle is 45ยบ
#
# The wall is 3.20 x 2.50 meters
#
# The sensor is placed slightly to the left of the wall
#
# The mean, variance and standard variation of the collected values are calculated
#

- The sensor could not detect the obstacle

- The hypotenuse is about 353.55cm, where the majority of the values are above or below this value -> the sensor could not also detect the hypotenuse
