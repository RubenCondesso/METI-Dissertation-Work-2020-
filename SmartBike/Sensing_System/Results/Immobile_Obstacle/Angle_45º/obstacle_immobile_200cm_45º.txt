# Output of the results from the detection of an obstacle, using the Ultrasonic Sensor
#
# Obstacle (wall) is immobile and at 200cm from the sensor
#
# Ultrasonic sensor is 1 meter high -> about the height of a bicycle
#
# The angle between the sensor and the obstacle is 45º
#
# The wall is 3.20 x 2.50 meters
#
# The sensor is placed facing the middle of the wall
#
# The mean, variance and standard variation of the collected values are calculated
#
