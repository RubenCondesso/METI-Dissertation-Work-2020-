# Output of the results from the detection of an obstacle, using the Ultrasonic Sensor
#
# Obstacle (wall) is immobile and at 350cm from the sensor
#
# Ultrasonic sensor is 1 meter high -> about the height of a bicycle
#
# The angle between the sensor and the obstacle is 60ยบ
#
# The wall is 3.20 x 2.50 meters
#
# The sensor is placed slightly to the left of the wall
#
# The mean, variance and standard variation of the collected values are calculated
#

- In this sample, values above (significantly) of 4 meters were allowed to "pass", in order to facilitate the analysis of this scenario, since (in this sample) there are both values above and below the maximum range of the sensor (4 meters)

- The sensor did not detected the obstacle -> it only detected its hypotenuse
