# Output of the results from the detection of a irregular immobile obstacle, in a simulated environment
#

# =================================================================================== Scenario conditions ===================================================================================== #

# Environment - simulated
#
# Obstacle - Car
# Obstacle's caractheristics - Irregular immobile obstacle, 1.60 x 1.50
$
# Distance (from the sensor) - 300cm
#
# Angle (between the sensor and the obstacle) - 90ยบ
#
# The sensor is placed facing the center of the car
#
# The sensor is 45cm high
#
# The mean, variance, standard variation, standard error and percentage error of the collected values are calculated
#
