# Output of the results from the detection of a regular immobile obstacle, in a simulated environment, using most 'likely approach'
#

# =================================================================================== Scenario conditions ===================================================================================== #

# Environment - simulated
#
# Obstacle - Wall
# Obstacle's caractheristics - Regular immobile obstacle, 1.60 x 2.50
$
# Distance (from the sensor) - 400cm
#
# Angle (between the sensor and the obstacle) - 60º
#
# The sensor is placed facing the center of the wall
#
# The mean, variance, standard variation, standard error and percentage error of the collected values are calculated
